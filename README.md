# Docker-Testing
Temporary repo to test GitHub, Docker and VSCode features

How to use:
- Clone the repo in a container with a named volume
- Name the volume like the name attribute in devtoncainer.json
- Keep the default folder name
- Edit the .localenv file as needed, copying variables from the .env file and editing their values. The .env file should not need to be changed, and the .localenv file will be ignored by source control.
